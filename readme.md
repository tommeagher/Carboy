#Carboy

Carboy, a sister of the <a href="https://github.com/tommeagher/alva">Alva ideablog</a>, is a nanoblog application built using the Flask Python microframework. Because who really needs another Tumblr?

It is customized, but based on the basic flaskr tutorial (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/introduction/), styled using Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

What have I added?
*Permalinks for each post
*The ability to edit any post
*The ability to delete any post

The development of this application is ongoing, but you can see the alpha version deployed at http://carboy.tommeagher.com/

The current alpha version is .5.
